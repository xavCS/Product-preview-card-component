From this project I mainly refined what I already knew of flexbox (which is not much) including things like flex-direction and improved on my ability to make responsive designs using media queries. 
I also learned about the ```<picture></picture>``` element and how I can use it to make responsive images that dynamically load in based on viewports which is nice as I was getting confused using the ```<img srcset="">``` method.

I would like to tackle some more projects that require responsiveness so that I can learn a lot more about positioning and display styles. I don't yet feel fully confident with things like grid or flex and I still find positioning in general to be a challenge.

For anyone trying to learn about key/fundamental concepts in CSS and HTML or even JS I would highly recommend the MDN documentation and especially their front-end development course which is completely free.
